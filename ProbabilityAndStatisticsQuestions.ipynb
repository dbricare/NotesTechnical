    "This requires hypothesis testing. Assign *null hypothesis* to be that the coin is fair, *alternative hypothesis* is coin is unfair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flips of a fair coin follow a binomial distribution which has **average** $\\mu = N \\cdot p$ and **standard deviation** $\\sigma = \\sqrt{N \\cdot p (1-p)}$. The probability of heads occurring is $p = 0.5$.\n",

    "**alternative hypothesis** $H_{a}: \\mu \\ne 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected, we need to calculate a p-value and select a statistical signficance level, the most common is 95% or $\\alpha = 0.05$. This means that only 5% of the time that this experiment is performed are we likely to see values as extreme as those given in the corresponding standard distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a sample of 10 flips and aren't sure what the true population values are for this coin, we apply a t-test where the number of degrees of freedom is $df = N - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9$. We must also compute the t-score to find where the measured value (8 heads) lies on the t-distribution in comparison to our selected significance level.\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\Delta}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{8 - 5}{\\sqrt{10 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5} / \\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{0.25}} = 6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a t-distribution with $9$ degrees of freedom the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$ is $2.262$. Since the calculated t-value is much greater than the critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis that the coin is fair at a significance of $p<0.05$.\n",
