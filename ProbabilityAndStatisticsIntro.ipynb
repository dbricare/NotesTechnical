Proper design of the experiment is crucial to drawing useful, valid inferences.\n",

Typically, the data is used to draw inference about model parameters such as $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ for a variable thought to behave like a normal distribution $N(\\mu,\\sigma)$. For two-outcome Bernolli distribution $Ber(p)$, the data can be used to draw inferences about the value of $p$. However the outcome is never certain, it always probabilistic.\n",
